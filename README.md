# 4Clojure Koans Solutions

This repository holds my solutions for the [4Clojure Koans](http://www.4clojure.com/problems).

The problems are solved top to bottom, not in the order of the problem numbers.

The files are named after the number of the problem they are solving. This has the advantage that the names will be unique and are easy to find.

The link to the corresponding problem can be found in a comment in every file.

# Howto

For every problem this should work:

* Open the problem file
* Go to the link in the comment of the file
* Copy the complete content of the file to the clipboard
* Paste the clipboard content in the text box of the problem
* Press *Run*

This should solve the corresponding problem.
